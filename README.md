# The house of tea. 

The house of tea is a web page for a fictional tearoom built using bootstrap. You can find the page here: https://sanbimu.github.io/restaurant-css-framework

The point of the exercise was to make a responsive website, with at least five accessible pages: a welcome page, a menu, a picture gallery, the restaurants' address and opening hours and a contact form.
